
This directory contains the base addons. 

You will almost always need to activate these addons, as most addons depend on either the templates or the files (and Base/Clear is ESSENTIAL except in certain very limited cases).

If you activate these addons you should get output that is functionally identical to vanilla DF.

Base/Clear:
	This must-have addon clears the output folder before generation.
	This addon is completely stand-alone.
	You should never disable this addon without a good reason!

Base/Files:
	The standard base addon. Contains Rubblized versions of the vanilla raw files. 
	Do not disable unless you have a replacement.

Base/Templates:
	This contains all kinds of useful templates.
	Required by most of the other addons.
	Do not disable unless you like error messages :)
