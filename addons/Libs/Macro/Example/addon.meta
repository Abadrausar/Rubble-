This addon takes ~7-8 seconds to generate (the cursor movement generation command is kinda slow, it's
a work in progress), in any case activating this addon more than triples normal run time.

Macro Description:
A cool fortress entrance, better have a bunch of miners...
I usually section this up and only dig the core passage to the central stairwell at first,
else you will spend far too much time digging things that you don't need until much later.

If you can, see the image "Pricetraded - Annotated Entry Blueprint.xcf", it has many more details
(including instructions for building the seesaw) all neatly written on overlays for each layer.
If you have a way to view that image (eg the GIMP or the like) then there is no real reason to read
most of these comments.

Generally I place this 15-20 Z-levels below the surface and build my entire fort above the main level
This requires extending the spiral wagon ramp all the way to the surface (for caravan access).

It is HIGHLY recommended to start with your cursor aligned to the grid, as everything
in this design is sized according to the distance the cursor moves when Shift+<direction> is pressed.

The little tunnel surrounding the wagon ramp is for use in engraving the wall above the down ramps,
they can also be used for marksdwarves later...

All invader accessible passages are separated from the walls by a channel, feel free to carve
fortifications in the walls (Bonus Idea: Carve fortifications in only one wall so you can recover
any bolts that missed and ended up in the channels after the battle).

The construct on the far left passage is a "Seesaw of Armok", a kind of powerful minecart grinder.
If you do not know how to build one then go ahead and redo that side of the fort with your favorite
kind of trap hall, if you remove the seesaw don't forget the parts that are above the main level.
(this is getting long enough without trying to explain how to build that too)
The idea is to make two four barrel seesaws. The lever room has space for two levers per seesaw,
one for the main operation and one for a special set of anti-flier hatch covers I normally install.
The reason the walls are dug in a serrated patten on the lower level is so that they may be replaced
with platinum, because being smashed between a platinum minecart and a rock wall just isn't as cool
as being smashed between a platinum minecart and a platinum wall... If you are more practical feel
free to edit the plans and save some work, after all you can always change your mind later :)

Speaking of the far left side, the four rooms here are for military training, and the area below
these rooms is for burial. If you tend to lose lots of dwarves you may wish to ditch my fancy
architecture for something with more floor space, just be careful not to dig into the channels...

The odd room on the main level near the center stairwell is the lever room. The undesignated spots 
(shaped like some demented animal) are where the levers go eventually, the 2x2 block on the
far left side is for the seesaw, if you are not building the seesaw then obviously these spots
can be used for other things. (the lever room is "position coded", eg every lever spot is placed
in the room relative to where it's bridge is in the fort)

If you do not need lever spots for the trap hall (the one to the far left) at all, then move all
lever positions one tile to the left, this will keep the levers centered in the room.

It should be obvious where bridges go, all bridges are 3X5 and raise in such a way as create an
impenetrable barrier (so long as the hatch covers are installed and locked)

There are many, many down stairs on the main level leading into the channels under where the bridges
go. These down stairs MUST be covered by locked hatch covers unless you want every dodging goblin to
have access to your fort! It is recommended to have at least a small military to make cleaning these
channels possible

If you wish the gap between the last set of bridges on each path can be filled with traps, this is
your best anti hidden necromancer defense...

The dead end on the far right side is for extension to a possible cavern exit (for caravans to use
to leave the fort during a siege).

2-Z above the main level I have a bedroom level, you may or may not want this, if not feel free to
remove it.

The small room directly above the entry tunnel is a F.R.O.G. (Fiend Revealing Observation Garrison)
Cover the holes in the floor with grates and station some animals here for ambush spotters.
This is only for last ditch detection, as anybody who gets this far can charge into the fort before
you can seal up unless the center path is already closed!
Unless you have another FROG farther up stream it is best to keep the center path sealed unless 3/4
of the fort is parading back and forth to the surface cleaning up a dead caravan or something.
(in which case a military is advised)

The big room in the middle of the right path is for the trade depot.

I use this entry in almost every fort I build, as it allows for a very powerful and flexible defense
when finished.

An XCF file is included, it has no use other than providing an easy way to look at the blueprint as
one layered image.
