	header=`This is the old research addon from Better Dorfs, reworked as a library.`
	
	description=`
All templates now take a "class" (basically a group id) and the reaction generator takes a building 
name, skill id, and reaction class. These changes allow modders to use the same framework for multiple 
different research buildings.
The templates for adding new research topics are always active, so optional support for addons that use 
this library is easy to add to your industry mods.
Many default addons register topics to the class "RESEARCH_GENERIC", so handle that class to if you 
want to support these addon's topics (nothing bad will happen if you don't).
