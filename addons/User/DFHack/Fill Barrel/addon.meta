	description=`
Works like the cart filler as far as finding the water goes.
Also allows you to fill water buckets for use in the hospital.
This addon is most for use in biomes where water freezes in the winter (so you can have water reserves).
Please note that AFAIK water barrels are not stockpilable.
Note that unlike most DFHack addons this one will still work without DFHack, it just won't
require/use water.
Why the still? Well the water needs to be purified somewhere right?
