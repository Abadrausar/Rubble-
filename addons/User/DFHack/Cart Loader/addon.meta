When powered this machine loads any items that are on it's input side into nearby minecarts.
If you want to load liquids see "User/DFHack/Cart Filler/Powered".

The direction given in the building name is the direction that items are loaded from,
the minecart may be in any of the 9 tiles around the loader.

Items are loaded one stack at a time once every 10 ticks.

Connecting machines must be built AFTER any mechanical workshop!

Based on the Masterwork Gnome mode machina scripts.
