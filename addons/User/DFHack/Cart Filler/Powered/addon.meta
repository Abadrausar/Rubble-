This addon works exactly the same with these additional rules (which are evaluated in order):
	If both magma and a magma safe minecart are present magma is loaded
	If any minecart and water is present water is loaded
	If magma is present and the only minecart(s) are not magma safe nothing happens
	If no minecarts are present nothing happens
	If no fluids are present nothing happens
