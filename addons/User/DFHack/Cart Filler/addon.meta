	description=`
To access fluids the filler needs to be adjacent to a downward passable tile leading to a cistern!
To fill a minecart it needs to be adjacent to or on top of the filler, the minecart is NOT
used as a reagent in the reaction. The best way to use the filler is to place it next to a
minecart stop (or stops) and a cistern, this allows you to fill minecarts and send them on
their way with a minimum of fuss.

The amount of liquid used is determined by the minecart capacity, but at least 4/7 fluid is
needed for the filler to function at all.

Uses the pump operator skill (to fill carts) and mechanics (to build the filler).
