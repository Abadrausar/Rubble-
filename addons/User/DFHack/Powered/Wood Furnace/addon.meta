	description=`
The powered wood furnace takes wooden planks from one side and outputs ash or charcoal
from the other, simple.

Input items MUST be on an input tile (a special one tile workshop), output is placed
beyond an output tile (which is also required). If multiple output tiles are provided
one is chosen at random each time (so output may be split).

Connecting machines must be built AFTER any mechanical workshop!
