	header=`A powered mill, grind plants to flour or dye powder.`
	
	description=`
The powered mill takes any millable plant and turns it into powder of the correct type.

Bags ARE required, place them on an input like any other input item.

Seeds are produced (if possible, they will not be created for seedless plants).

Input items MUST be on an input tile (a special one tile workshop), output is placed
beyond an output tile (which is also required). If multiple output tiles are provided
one is chosen at random each time (so output may be split).

Connecting machines must be built AFTER any mechanical workshop!
