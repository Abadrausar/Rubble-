The item sorter is very simple, you choose what kind of item it should sort and
it retrieves any of that item it finds in its inputs and moves them to it's outputs.

To sort items simply make several sorters share an input.

Due to the way sorters work you may sort at most eight types of items from a single tile.
Sorting more than eight item types is simply not possible (and eight can be awkward to
impossible in most cases), so design your factories so this is not required.

Did you know that input and output blocks could be placed diagonally? This property
can be VERY useful with sorters.

If a sorter has no input block it will take from any adjacent tile, this is useful for
linking stockpiles to your productions lines.

If you say no to both options when setting the sorter it will take any item!

Sorters are designed to do simple tasks, like separating glass from empty bags at the
powered glass forge outputs and other tasks of that "sort".

Another good use is combining several production lines outputs into a single minecart
route and then splitting them at the destination. Sorters may also be used to create
"conveyor belts" for when powered workshops are just a little too far apart (use
minecarts for longer routes).

The sorter uses a slightly different API for managing it's settings. This API is a
little less reliable, but the "normal" way would require almost 90 different workshops
and well over 8000 reactions! (and with much reduced functionality at that!) This slowed
Rubble to a crawl and I don't even want to think about what it would do to DF.
Anyway, if a sorter gets "stuck" or forgets what it is supposed to be sorting designating
a new workshop to be built should fix it, if not run the setting adjust reaction again.

Despite it's grouping this workshop does not require power (it would be too hard
to connect up most of the time).
