The item sorter is very simple, you choose what kind of item it should sort and
it retrieves any of that item it finds in its inputs and moves them to it's outputs.

Sorters may sort by item type (and optionally subtype) and/or material, plus you may set
a "output item limit". If there are more items on the output tile(s) than the limit no
more items will be sorted until some of the items on the output are removed. This is good
to keep too many items piling up at workshop inputs (which can starve other workshops).

If you wish you may "invert" the sorter settings, this means that the sorter will take
everything EXCEPT what you selected, very useful!

To sort items simply make several sorters share an input.

Due to the way sorters work you may sort at most eight types of items from a single tile.
Sorting more than eight item types is simply not possible (and eight can be awkward to
impossible in most cases), so design your factories so this is not required.

Did you know that input and output blocks could be placed diagonally? This property
can be VERY useful with sorters.

If a sorter has no input block it will take from any adjacent tile, this is useful for
linking stockpiles to your productions lines.

If you say no to all options when setting the sorter it will take any item!

Sorters are designed to do simple tasks, like separating glass from empty bags at the
powered glass forge outputs and other tasks of that "sort".

Another good use is combining several production lines outputs into a single minecart
route and then splitting them at the destination. Sorters may also be used to create
"conveyor belts" for when powered workshops are just a little too far apart (use
minecarts for longer routes).

Despite it's grouping this workshop does not require power (it would be too hard
to connect up most of the time). If you wish to have sorters require power there
is a configuration variable that may be set.
