	header=`Single tile powered boolean logic gates! (experimental)`
	
	description=`
If you do not know why boolean logic is useful keep your hands off!

This addon is experimental and utterly untested, the final version will
likely be quite different!

The gates that are currently available are strictly to allow me to test the
basic concept and make sure it will work. Before I make the full version I
will make a generic API to encapsulate the functionality I pioneer here.

Eventually building type will be selected by reaction and this system will
include programmable sensors (item counters, cart detectors, and anything
else I can think of that can have a meaningful boolean output) and the like.

Currently logic gates only receive input from axles and output by setting
the state of a variety of buildings:
	gear assemblies (engaged/disengaged)
	doors (open/closed)
	hatch covers (open/closed)
	wall and floor grates (open/closed)
	vertical and floor bars (open/closed)
	floodgates (open/closed)
	upright spike traps (extended/retracted)
	bridges (extended/retracted)
	levers (and anything connected to the lever! on/off)

Connecting machines must be built AFTER any mechanical workshop!
