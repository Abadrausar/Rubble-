When powered this machine loads any items that are on it's input side into nearby minecarts.
If you want to load liquids see "User/DFHack/Cart Filler/Powered".

Input items MUST be on an input tile (a special one tile workshop), items are then loaded
onto any adjacent minecart.

If the cart loader has an output it will load items into the cart in the output tile, otherwise
it will use any adjacent minecart.

To keep your dwarves from stealing the items from the input tile either make sure they can't
path to the input or dump the items there with a sorter (which, like all machines, forbids
items that it places on an input).

Items are loaded one stack at a time once every 10 ticks.

A common problem with cart loaders is loading the wrong cart. If your cart loader seems
to not be loading properly make sure it is not putting the items into the wrong minecart!

Connecting machines must be built AFTER any mechanical workshop!

Based on the Masterwork Gnome mode machina scripts.
