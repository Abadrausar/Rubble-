	description=`
When powered this machine launches any adjacent minecarts that are
sufficiently full in any direction you choose.

To build a cart launcher you must build the basic building, then run a reaction
to set the launch direction and fullness threshold. Until these are set the
building is useless. The launcher needs to be powered before it may be adjusted!

Keep in mind that this does not give carts sufficient velocity to boost them
off a high speed track stop! You will have to come up with a different system
for stopping your carts.

The system I found to work best is a T shaped track, where the cart runs into a wall
then entering the T and stops, the the cart launcher launches the cart down the other
(perpendicular) leg. An even easier system is just to launch the cart back the way it
came (provided that is possible of course). For multiple carts (with a single loader)
dropping the carts from above (and allowing them to stack up if more than one is
awaiting loading) works well.

Good for use with "User/DFHack/Powered/Cart Loader" or "User/DFHack/Powered/Cart Filler".

Connecting machines must be built AFTER any mechanical workshop!
