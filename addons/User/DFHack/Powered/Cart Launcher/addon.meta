	header=`Launch full minecarts automatically.`
	
	description=`
When powered this machine launches any adjacent minecarts that are
sufficiently full in any direction you choose.

If the cart launcher has an output it will launch the cart in the output tile,
otherwise it will launch any adjacent minecart.

To build a cart launcher you must build the basic building, then run a reaction
to set the launch direction and fullness threshold. Until these are set the
building is useless. The launcher needs to be powered before it may be adjusted!

Good for use with "User/DFHack/Powered/Cart Loader" or "User/DFHack/Powered/Cart Filler".

Connecting machines must be built AFTER any mechanical workshop!
