	header=`A powered version of the block cutter.`
	
	description=`
The powered block cutter takes any boulders and turns them into 4 blocks of whatever color you want.
To change the color run one of the adjustment reactions, same goes for input/output directions.

The powered block cutter only makes normal quality blocks, but who cares? It's automatic!

The block cutter will consume any boulder! If you put in ores or other valuable stones it
will happily cut them into blocks, whether this is a good thing or not is up to you...

Input items MUST be on an input tile (a special one tile workshop), output is placed
beyond an output tile (which is also required). If multiple output tiles are provided
one is chosen at random each time (so output may be split).

Connecting machines must be built AFTER any mechanical workshop!
