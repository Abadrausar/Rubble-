	header=`A powered smelter, ore to bars, no dwarves required.`
	
	description=`
The powered smelter is really simple, ore and fuel goes in, bars come out.

Input items MUST be on an input tile (a special one tile workshop), output is placed
beyond an output tile (which is also required). If multiple output tiles are provided
one is chosen at random each time (so output may be split).

To operate the powered smelter requires adjacent magma or fuel on an input (magma is given priority).

Connecting machines must be built AFTER any mechanical workshop!
