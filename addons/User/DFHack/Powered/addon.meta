First: If you are looking to produce high quality items, look elsewhere. The various 
production buildings do a pretty good job, but nothing beats a skilled craftsman at a
normal workshop for quality.

Second: I tested everything at least once, but there may still be bugs, so be careful.
That said many "bugs" turned out to be goofed setups, so make sure your inputs/outputs
are correct before complaining (for example one weird issue turned out to be a misplaced
output tile).

The powered workshops follow more or less the same pattern, they take any input items
they may need from any adjacent inputs and place any output items just beyond any outputs.

Input tiles and output tiles are specified with special one tile workshops. If an output
item is placed on an input tile it will be automatically forbidden. This will keep your
dwarves from disrupting the (hopefully) smooth operation of your production lines by
stealing half finished products.

Note: If you place an output diagonally off a workshop's corner it will place the item
diagonally as well! This means that it is possible to chain workshops diagonally or even
cross two production lines (by sharing an output).

Shared/crossed output example:
	o: output
	i: input
	a: workshop from line 1
	b: workshop from line 2
	Items flow from top to bottom
	
	 aaa bbb
	 aaa bbb
	 aaa bbb
	    o
	   i i
	 bbb aaa
	 bbb aaa
	 bbb aaa

It is also possible to make a circle with three workshops!
(a gives to c and b, b gives to a and c, c gives to a and b)
	o: output
	i: input
	a: workshop 1
	b: workshop 2
	c: workshop 3
	
	 aaa
	 aaa
	 aaai
	  iobbb
	cccibbb
	ccc bbb
	ccc

These kinds of setups are less useful than a straight line in most cases, but they should
give you some kind of idea of what is possible.

Workshops will use ANY adjacent output or input! This makes things very flexible, but
sometimes this can make things difficult. I suggest that you spread things out as much
as possible to help keep sharing "issues" from occurring.

If a workshop has multiple output tiles it will choose one at random for each item it
produces, so using two or more outputs allows you to split a workshop's output more-or-less
evenly (subject to the whims of RNG of course).

Some workshops produce more than one type of item, for example the powered glass furnace
makes both glass and empty bags, use a sorter to separate dissimilar outputs (the sorter
may also discriminate based on material!).

An example of a bad setup (that got me):
This was *supposed* to sort bags and send them right while glass when straight, but sometimes
bags ended up on top of the glass furnace, can you spot the issue?
	o: output
	i: input
	s: sorter
	l: cart loader
	a: glass furnace
	
	 o
	 s
	 isoil
	 o
	aaa
	aaa
	aaa

The problem is that the bag sorter and the glass furnace shared an output, moving the sorters
(and their inputs and outputs) fixed the issue:
	o
	s s
	 i o l
	 o  i
	aaa
	aaa
	aaa

I suggest you play around with inputs and outputs until you fully understand how they work!

The first input in a production chain is a little hard to feed without having your dwarves
insisting on taking the items to a stockpile, use a sorter to feed the items. As a sorter
without an input tile will take any adjacent items, just use a setup like this:
	=: input stockpile
	o: output
	i: input
	s: sorter
	a: workshop
	
	===
	=s=
	=o=
	 i
	aaa
	aaa
	aaa

If you do not want the above system to pile all the items of the correct type in your fortress
on the input tile it would probably be a good idea to set an output limit on the sorter!
Be aware that sorter output limits count ALL items on ALL of the sorter's output tiles!

Make sure you read and understand the addon description for the sorter! This building plays
a critical role in any advanced factory!

The final destination of most production lines is a powered factory, this building requires
a dwarf to operate and produces many kinds of items from wood, stone or glass.
It uses the same kind of input/output system as the other workshops with the exception that
an output is not required (with no output the items are dumped in the middle of the factory).

If you just want items in a hurry the powered mason and carpenter may be more your speed.
They both produce items without the need for a dwarf (keep coffins coming during a tantrum
spiral!) but the items are a little more expensive and will be lower quality than can be made
by a skilled dwarf.

The glass furnace and kiln may operate either as a raw material generator for the factory or on
their own like the powered mason and carpenter, which way to run them is up to you.

Many of the powered workshops are made to fill a specific slot in a production line, but
they work just as well by themselves. For example a powered wood furnace is mostly designed
as an intermediate stage between a powered sawmill and a powered kiln or smelter, but it also
works well with that unpowered sawmill that is scrapping all that wooden crap you stole from
the last elven caravan :p

If a machine seems to not be working look at the DFHack console, if you don't see lots of errors
the problem is most likely a missing or incorrect input item. Read the workshop's addon description
for details about what it expects, you may have forgotten something.
