	description=`
The powered kiln can make fired items from clay or pearlash from ash.

Input items MUST be on an input tile (a special one tile workshop), output is placed
beyond an output tile (which is also required). If multiple output tiles are provided
one is chosen at random each time (so output may be split).

To operate the powered kiln requires adjacent magma or fuel on an input (magma is given priority).

Connecting machines must be built AFTER any mechanical workshop!
