	header=`A powered kiln, turn clay into pottery boulders.`
	
	description=`
The powered kiln can make fired boulders from clay or pearlash from ash.

To make pottery items you need to use the boulders with another workshop (a powered block
cutter + a powered factory works well).

Input items MUST be on an input tile (a special one tile workshop), output is placed
beyond an output tile (which is also required). If multiple output tiles are provided
one is chosen at random each time (so output may be split).

To operate the powered kiln requires adjacent magma or fuel on an input (magma is given priority).

Try sawmill+wood furnace+quarry+kiln+block cutter+factory! When connected in the right
manner you can turn wood into pottery with this setup while using only minimal dwarf labor.

Connecting machines must be built AFTER any mechanical workshop!
