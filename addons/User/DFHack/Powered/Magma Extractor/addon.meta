	header=`An automatic powered version of the "User/DFHack/Magma/Extractor" addon.`
	
	description=`
This addon works mostly the same as "User/DFHack/Magma/Extractor", just without dwarf labor.

Output is placed beyond an output tile (which is required). If multiple output tiles are
provided one is chosen at random each time (so output may be split).

Connecting machines must be built AFTER any mechanical workshop!
