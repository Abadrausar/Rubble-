	header=`A powered quarry, when built over clay provides a steady supply of boulders.`
	
	description=`
The powered quarry is very simple, if built over the correct tile it provides clay or
sand, automatically. Sand mining requires bags, have your dwarves dump them on an input tile.

Currently the quarry can be built on any soil and always produces clay or sand (so no
red sand or fire clay), sorry technical issues.

Output is placed beyond an output tile (which is required). If multiple output tiles are
provided one is chosen at random each time (so output may be split).

Connecting machines must be built AFTER any mechanical workshop!
