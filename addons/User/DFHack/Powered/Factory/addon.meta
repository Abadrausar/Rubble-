	header=`Adds a factory building for making batches of items from blocks, planks and raw glass.`
	
	description=`
Create most furniture and tools from nearby blocks, planks and raw glass.

This factory is kinda like the powered mason, carpenter or glass furnace in that it
produces items with minimal dwarf labor. The difference is that those buildings require
NO dwarves, while this one requires at least one. In trade for a little more dwarf labor
the items are cheaper and have a better chance to be higher quality (with a skilled worker).
In addition the factory produces items in batches of five.

Required raw materials are taken from tiles adjacent to the factory, so your dwarves
spend less time hauling and more time working! A dwarf is still required to do the
reaction, but he doesn't have to haul the reagents which, for 8 blocks, can take far
more time than running the reaction.

Input items MUST be on an input tile (a special one tile workshop), if an output tile is
available it is used, but an output is not required (items will be ejected in the center
of the factory if no output is provided).

Unlike the "User/Factory" addon this addon only allows you to use blocks or planks.

Connecting machines must be built AFTER any mechanical workshop!
