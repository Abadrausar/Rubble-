	description=`
This machine provides 5 power all the time, use to power small
machines that would be hard to connect to a conventional power source.

As each engine produces so little power (and costs so much to build) producing
enough power to run larger machines is not really worth the effort.

Use steam engines from "User/DFHack/Steam" or vanilla water wheels and windmills
for larger machines (or groups of machines).

Most if not all machines will require two or more engines to run.

Connecting machines must be built AFTER any mechanical workshop!
