	header=`The obsidian caster makes obsidian boulders directly from adjacent water and magma.`
	
	description=`
The fluids need to be on the level below and accessible via downward passable tiles.
4/7 water and magma are used for every boulder (so clever engineers can still be more efficient).
Uses the pump operator skill (to operate) and mechanics (to build the caster).
