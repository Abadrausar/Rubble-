	description=`
The magma is put into an adjacent magma-safe minecart or an adjacent cistern.
When using minecarts this works exactly like the magma cart filler, when using a cistern it will 
attempt to spawn magma into any open space below an adjacent downward passable tile.

DO NOT BUILD THIS BUILDING NEXT TO YOUR MAIN STAIRWELL!

It is possible to enable magma workshops/furnaces here as well, so if you don't have a volcano there
is no need to dig to the magma sea if you don't wish to.

Uses the furnace operator skill.
