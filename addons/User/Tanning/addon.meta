	header=`Allows creatures to give more than one skin based on size.`
	
	description=`
Makes creatures give skin "globs" instead of "skins" when butchered, this allows large animals to
produce more than one piece of leather once tanned.
If "User/Fix/Usable Scale" is activated then scale is changed as well.
Based on a mod/modders resource by sackhead.
