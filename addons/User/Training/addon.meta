	description=`
Make ink from ash, and paper from wood, then make a book from paper and ink and read it for exp in
your chosen skill. Note that EVERY skill in the game can be trained this way, even the useless ones ;).
Making books uses the Alchemy skill.
Note that skills that do not have a labor appear to allow ANYONE to do the reaction,
use workshop profiles.
