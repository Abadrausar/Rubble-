	header=`Greatly expands the glazing system.`
	
	description=`
Allows you to grind minerals and ores into glaze powders of various colors and then use these powders 
to glaze various items. Unlike vanilla there is not a glazing reaction for each item type, use 
stockpiles to restrict item usage.
Each mineral or ore boulder is ground into 10 units of glaze powder, ash bars only produce 3 units.
There are four different kinds of glazing you may do:
	Ash glazing uses one unit of ash to glaze an item, simple and cheap.
	Monochrome glazing uses two units of any color glaze to glaze an item.
	Dichrome glazing uses one unit of white glaze and one unit of any other color to glaze an item, 
	this is more valuable than monochrome and has an additional chance of having bands on the item
	for even more value.
	Polychrome glazing uses one unit of white and one unit each of blue, red, and yellow glaze to glaze 
	an item, like dichrome this adds lots of value and each non-white color has a chance of adding 
	bands. If you get lucky your simple pot could become very valuable!

version has had the reactions completely reworked as well as a few other balancing changes.
