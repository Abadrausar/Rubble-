Make torch "shields" to suppress the speluncaphobia effect.

WARNING! In testing with DFHack 40.15 r1 this addon caused the game to
immediately crash whenever a speluncaphobia enabled creature entered the
map (or as soon as the game was unpaused if such a creature was already
on the map)! This will not happen if the modtools/item-trigger commands
are disabled, so I am inclined to believe it is a DFHack bug.
