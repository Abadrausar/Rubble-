The warcrafter allows you to make:
	Scalemail armor from leather, bone, and shell
	Bolts and arrows from bone and shell
	Heavy cloaks from leather
	Green glass weapons and armor (if the "User/Glass Forge" addon is active)
Making bone and shell items requires you to cut them into "scales" first.
