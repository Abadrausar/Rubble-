	description=`
Adds a bunch of adventure mode reactions, mostly for making use of bones and skin (via bone and leather 
items, mostly armor but also a few other useful things including a few bone weapons)
This addon is mostly for those who do not wish to use the advfort DFHack script, but still want to do 
some basic crafting.
Supports "User/Tanning" and "User/Fix/Usable Scale", but a DF bug keeps the support for "User/Tanning" 
from working correctly, it works but it requires lots of hunting to get much leather (the tanning 
reaction always takes two stacks of skin, and produces one tanned hide no matter how large the stacks 
are, so "User/Tanning" actually REDUCES the hide output in adventure mode).
