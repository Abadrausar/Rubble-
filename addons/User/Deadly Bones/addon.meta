Basically all it does is add a weakness to LOCAL_CREATURE_MAT:BONE to any creatures
that have the STANDARD_MATERIALS body detail plan.

I am not 100% sure this works properly, must test.
Sadly arena testing will not work (can't make bone items).

The fastest way to test this in a controlled manner would be to make some goblin bone
blocks and do drop testing onto a floor of these blocks with other goblins.
Of course captured goblins and some goblin bone would be required...
