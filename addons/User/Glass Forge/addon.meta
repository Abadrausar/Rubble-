	header=`The glass forge allows you to make armor and weapons from all three kinds of glass.`
	
	description=`
Green glass is a little under iron grade, clear glass is equivalent to iron, and crystal glass
is a little under steel.

If you melt down glass items you will get "bars" of glass, you can melt these bars back to raw glass
if you wish, or you can use them at the forge to make other glass items.
If you wish you can also make bars directly from raw glass.
