	header=`Adds a large factory building for making batches of cheap items (mostly from wood and stone).`
	
	description=`
Allows you to make all kinds of furniture as well as sets of clothing, and batches of tools.

All factory reactions are just a little bit cheaper than the vanilla version.
All factory items that can be made from stone and wood also have a version that can be made
from blocks or planks, save even more resources!

All reactions use the mechanics skill.
