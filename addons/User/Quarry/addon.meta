There are two types of quarry:
	Quarry: 8 blocks, 4 mechanisms, 2 giant corkscrews, 10x10
		Dig for clay; 100% chance of a clay boulder, 10% chance of additional fire clay boulder
		Dig for sand; 100% chance for a bag of sand
		Dig for stone; 2% chance for 12 different layer stones
	Makeshift Quarry, free, 5x5
		Dig for clay; 20% chance of a clay boulder
		Dig for sand; 20% chance for a bag of sand
You can use a quarry to dig for resources that do not exist in your current fort, so if you use quarries you never need to worry if you proposed embark has sand or clay.
Uses the pump operator skill.
