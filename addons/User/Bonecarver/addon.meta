	header=`Adds a workshop for advanced shaping of bone.`
	
	description=`
Allows you to make basic furniture and some items from your choice of bone or a fake "bone" stone
(to allow better stockpiling).

Blocks may also be made from a fire safe "treated bone" material, this makes item-less embarks
a little less dependent upon caravans.
