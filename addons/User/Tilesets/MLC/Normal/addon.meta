	header=`A simple addon that installs my custom ASCII-like tileset (normal version).`
	
	description=`
This version is very close to default ASCII (a few tiles are graphical).
Comes in two sizes, a 16x16 for fullscreen mode and a 10x10 for windowed mode.
This addon makes no raw changes, so it should be usable with all ASCII compatible mods.
