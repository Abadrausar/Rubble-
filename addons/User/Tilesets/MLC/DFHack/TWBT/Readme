This is a version of my personal tileset made to work with the Text Will Be Text DFHack plugin.
Most of the graphics have been redrawn to use finer lines and/or a little gray to provide a mild 3D effect, if you dislike this feel free to replace any tiles you wish with better versions :)

I am not completely done with this, as I would like to override the tiles used for all the buildings as well as a few more item tiles, maybe someday...

MLC 16x16 - Font.png
	This tilesheet is perfectly ASCII, no graphical tiles at all.
	Used for text.

MLC 16x16 - Graphics.png
	This tilesheet has a few graphical tiles, but mostly it is the same as the font sheet.
	Default tiles for the game view.

MLC 16x16 - Override.png
	This sheet contains all the override tiles, eg all the specific graphics.
	Override tiles for the game view.

The basic font is a hand resized version of the CLA 18x18 font
The track tiles are cleaned up and simplified versions of the ones from the SpaceFox tileset
The backgrounds for the numbers were copied without changes from the Masterwork tileset
A few of the graphical tiles are redrawn from various other tilesets, mostly I just used the outlines.

Fun fact for the day: Bit-map fonts cannot be copyrighted, odd...
Any way I am not sure if most of these sheets can really be considered a font anymore, if not just think of them as being CC0 :)
