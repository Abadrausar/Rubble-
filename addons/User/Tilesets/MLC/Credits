Fun fact for the day: Bit-map fonts cannot be copyrighted, odd...
In any case that's no big deal, as I would just make these CC0 anyway.

10x10 sheets
	These tilesheets are all hand drawn by me to match the 16x16 tiles as closely as possible.
	
16x16 sheets
	Most of the tiles on these sheets are resized from the CLA 18x18 tileset, all tiles were resized/redrawn by hand.
	The track tiles are slightly edited versions of the ones from the SpaceFox tileset (Track end tiles drawn to match by me).
	Graphical tiles were mostly drawn by me, a few were drawn using tiles from other sets as guides.
