	description=`
Stretch your precious Adamantine supply, make mithril.
Mithril is a very light and sharp alloy that is made from steel and aluminum with a small
admixture of adamantine, thereby greatly extending your adamantine supply
(at the cost of slightly worse performance). 

Mithril is a little better than steel grade plus it is lighter and sharper.
