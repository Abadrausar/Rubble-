	header=`Makes giant and animal man vermin show up properly.`
	
	description=`
This adds two fixes:
	Forces all giant animals to have a life span of at least 10 years.
	Replaces all pool biome tags in giant and animal-man creatures with the correct lake biome.

This is useful to make variations on vermin appear in game and to help them live long enough
to be interesting.
