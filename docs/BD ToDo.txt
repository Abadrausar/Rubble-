
Better Dorfs todo list
The following is a unsorted list of things I (may) want to add to better dorfs at some point

Flesh out orcs
	As of now they are just up-sized goblins that can use bronze and steel.

Dwarf castes
	Add a few castes to the dwarves, not too many

Training system
	Not sure if I want something as complicated as the masterwork library system

Combat arena
	A place to spawn creatures to fight. Basically turn some kind of pet into a monster. Maybe allow the creation of necromancers for use in fancy traps, training systems, bone generators and more.

Maybe make elves and saurians mortal enemies?
	Not sure how (or if) this can be done without making elves hate dwarves as well
