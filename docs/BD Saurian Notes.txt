Saurian Notes:
==============================================

Saurians are a small (size 20000) reptilian race of swamp dwellers with mildly venomous bites (causes pain).
Saurians cannot dig stone and so they get the little metal they use from their hated foe, the goblins, or from trade.

Tips:
==============================================
	Embark in an area with an aquifer.
		Aquifers provide easy to get drinking water, much faster to set up than a cistern and screw pump and much safer than a river.
		
	Use hunters.
		Saurians are good hunters and so long as your arrows hold out you can get large amounts of good cheap food without having to worry about diverting farm space. The other animal products gathered are just as valuable, leather is one of the components for the best armor material available to saurians and bone makes a good source of hunting/training arrows. In late/mid game hunters can become valuable additions to your military as snipers.
	
	Embark in an area with clay.
		Saurians can make all sorts of stuff out of clay. If you neglect this you will have a much harder time of it.
	
	Bring a serrated disk or materials to make one
		This is an important part for making the sawmill. The sawmill will supercharge your early industry and save you huge amounts of wood via processing young trees and burning scrap for much needed fuel.
	
	Start a large wire weed plot in the first season or so.
		Wire weed takes a long time to grow, it's best to get your crop going ASAP so you can make armor later.
	
	Pay attention to your saurian's castes.
		You can of course just assign anyone to anything but if you try to make sure you match jobs to caste bonuses you can get that extra little bit of performance that can sometimes make a big difference. For example shaman caste saurians make good support troops or doctors but would be wasted as farmers or crafters.
	
	Don't forget bone blocks.
		Since you lack stone, bone blocks can make a good, early, fire-safe building material. This is mostly useful for item-less embarks but can come in handy for other cases as well.
	
	Buy metal whenever you can!
		Iron is rare and expensive, but crucial for making weapons (and to a lesser extent armor). You will need every little bit you can get. Try to save your water steel for arming your best troops. Don't forget copper, it's great for arrows and arming your early militia. Dwarves should bring all the other metals, so having lots of valuable trade goods ready and waiting is a very good thing.
	
	Buy rare items like gems, silk and stone ASAP.
		If you need raw gems you can "uncut" large gems you trade for at the craftsaurian, if you need cut gems you can use glass. Stone boulders can be pressed from blocks at the craftsaurian or fired from clay at the kiln and batch kiln. Silk cloth is (AFAIK) only available from the dwarves, unless you get VERY luck and have some web vermin in the area. 
	
	Do not embark with tree seeds.
		Each farmable tree corresponds to a vanilla DF tree. If you are not careful it is easy to embark with seeds that have the wrong biome needs to grow at your location. Whenever possible gather the required seeds on location.

	Do not plant (most) aboveground crops in autumn.
		Most of the above ground plants grow in one season. This means that anything planted in summer will be harvested in autumn, and anything planted in autumn harvested in winter. The problem is that above ground plant seeds will rot in the field in winter. The exception to this rule is wire weed which, as it takes much longer to grow, can survive winter just fine. This means that in practice you will only get two harvests a year from any one field.
