
Web UI:
	The server should manage the state better:
		The server should support multiple users.
			This will require tracking users and keeping a separate state for each transaction.
	
Make a "package server", where raws are served to the world and generating makes (or fetches from a cache) a zipped version of the generated raws.
	Would require some fancy footwork where AXIS is concerned.
	Could run more-or-less in batch mode, as there would be no need to support anything other than simple generation.
	Not a high priority unless there is a place to host it (app engine?).
