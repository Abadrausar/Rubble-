Included Addons:
==============================================

Rubble includes all kinds of useful addons, some for developers and some for end users. These addons are included in an attempt to ensure that Rubble has something for everyone, and to provide a broad base of examples for aspiring addon developers.

If you want to generate the Rubble version of "vanilla DF" you will need to activate the "Base" addon, this addon is already active by default.

All addons will automatically activate any dependencies, so don't worry if the addon list that is generated is a little different from what you selected.

A few of the addons allow you to make gloves via reactions, unfortunately these gloves will be unusable (it's a vanilla bug). If you have DFHack this will be fixed automatically.

This list is automatically generated, for the full description of an addon see it's web UI addon description page.
