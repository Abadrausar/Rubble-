==============================================
Included Addons:
==============================================

Rubble includes all kinds of useful addons, some for developers and some for end users. These addons are included in an attempt to ensure that Rubble has something for everyone, and to provide a broad base of examples for aspiring addon developers.

If you want to generate the Rubble version of "vanilla DF" you will need to activate the "Base" addon, this addon is already active by default.

All addons will automatically activate any dependencies, so don't worry if the addon list that is generated is a little different from what you selected.

All of the DFHack stuff is made under the assumption that what worked with 34.11 and DFHack r5e1 will work with the 40.x DFHack when it is available.
If this is not true some or all of the DFHack related addons will not work.

A few of the addons allow you to make gloves via reactions, unfortunately these gloves will be unusable (it's a vanilla bug). If you have DFHack this will be fixed automatically.

This list is not perfect, it may be slightly out of date and/or be slightly wrong about something. For the latest information on each addon see its description page in the Web UI.

Base:
	The standard base addon. Contains Rubblized versions of the vanilla raw files. 
	Do not disable unless you have a replacement.
	The following changes have been made from vanilla:
		Some of the files have been re-indented (tag order is not effected).
		The dwarf creature has templates from the "Libs/Castes" addon installed.
		Specialized SHARED_OBJECT templates have been inserted where appropriate.
		REACTION and BUILDING_WORKSHOP templates have been inserted where appropriate.
		@BUILD_KEY templates have been inserted where appropriate.
		ADDON_HOOKS have been added to all entities.
		!ENTITY_PLAYABLE templates have been added to all entities.
		The dwarven outpost liaison has been modded to works as a trade rep if the dwarves are unplayable.
		Dwarves have the alchemist labor permitted in their entity.
		Vermin creatures have #TILE and #COLOR templates inserted.
		All file IDs have been stripped.

Dev:
	The addons in this group are for addon developers, most people may safely ignore them.
	
	Dev/Cheat:
		A bunch of cheat reactions to allow for fast setup of testing forts.
		Build a "Heavy Supply Wagon" workshop, both the building and all reactions are free.
		Uses animal caretaker skill (the most useless skill I could think of :p)
	
	Dev/Dummy Reactions:
		This addon adds "dummy reactions" eg. empty reactions registered to "ADDON_HOOK_PLAYABLE".
		By default 15 reactions are created, if you want a different number of reactions to be generated pass '-config="DEV_DUMMY_REACTION_COUNT=count"' to Rubble when generating.
		These reactions are empty by default, use if you want to add new content after worldgen.
	
	Dev/Tileset/Export:
		This addon is a helper for extracting tileset information from raws that have the Rubble tileset templates added. See "Dev/Tileset/Insert".
		The extracted tile numbers will be written to "./dev_export_tileset.tile_info.rbl".
		Basically an automatic replacement for the old #WRITE_TILESET template.
	
	Dev/Tileset/Insert:
		This addon adds the SHARED_OBJECT templates to all the tileset sensitive objects.
		Advanced users may want to set the config var "DEV_TILESET_INSERT_EXPORT=true" in order to get the resulting files output to the current working directory, this is a great help when porting a mod to Rubble.
		Use with "Dev/Tileset/Export" to export tile/color info from non-Rubble raws.
		This addon also handles vermin creature tile numbers and colors.

Libs:
	The addons in this group are libraries, eg they provide functionality used by other addons.
	Any templates added by these addons are fully documented, see "Rubble Libs Templates.txt" and "Rubble Base Templates.txt".
	All of the addons in this group are automatically managed. They do not show as options to choose when generating as they are activated and deactivated automatically.
	The Libs addons are only listed here for the edification of modders.

	Libs/Base:
		All the base templates and other such stuff, critical to normal operation.
		This addon is a "critical addon" meaning that it is needed by the base for normal operation.
	
	Libs/Castes:
		Adds support for dynamically adding castes to a creature.
		This addon is a "critical addon" meaning that it is needed by the base for normal operation.
	
	Libs/Castes/DFHack/Transform:
		Adds support for transforming castes.
		Basically just a gender aware and pared down version of "modtools/transform-unit" (with specialized versions of DFHACK_REACTION and DFHACK_REACTION_BIND for easy use).
		Does not require "Libs/Castes", but it is designed to work with it.
	
	Libs/Crates:
		Adds infrastructure for "crates", eg bars that can be bought from caravans and then "unpacked" via special reactions into items.
		Most of the templates added by this addon are always available (even when the addon is not active).
	
	Libs/DFHack/Add Reaction:
		Allows you to add reactions to buildings that are normally not possible to add reactions to, also allows you to remove all hardcoded reactions from a building.
		WARNING! Largely untested!
	
	Libs/DFHack/Announcement:
		This addon provides templates for displaying announcements to the player.
		The announcements work via specialized variants of the DFHACK_REACTION and DFHACK_REACTION_BIND templates.
		The templates added by this addon are always available (even when the addon is not active).
	
	Libs/DFHack/Fix Handedness:
		Automatically installs and activates a fix for making gloves in reactions.
	
	Libs/DFHack/Fluids:
		Installs the extremely useful rubble.fluids Lua pseudo module and it's companion command rubble_fluids.
		(adds no templates)
	
	Libs/DFHack/Timeout:
		Adds a Lua pseudo module (rubble.timeout) that adds support for persistent time delays (eg they survive a save/load).
		Includes a simple command for use with reaction trigger.
		(adds no templates)
	
	Libs/Macro:
		A modders resource for generating macros from scripts.
		Adds no templates, only script commands.
	
	Libs/Macro/Example:
		A simple addon that generates a large complicated macro from images, makes a good demo/test of "Libs/Macro".
		This addon takes ~7-8 seconds to generate (the cursor movement generation command is kinda slow, it's a work in progress), in any case activating this addon more than triples normal run time.
	
	Libs/Research:
		This is the old research addon from Better Dorfs, reworked as a library.
		All templates now take a "class" (basically a group id) and the reaction generator takes a building name, skill id, and reaction class. These changes allow modders to use the same framework for multiple different research buildings.
		The templates for adding new research topics are always active, so optional support for addons that use this library is easy to add to your industry mods.
		Many default addons register topics to the class "RESEARCH_GENERIC", so handle that class to if you want to support these addon's topics (nothing bad will happen if you don't).

User:
	All the addons in this group are things that are of interest only to end users.
	
	User/Adv Reactions:
		Adds some basic adventure mode crafting reactions, mostly useful to help jump-start use of advfort.
		Allows you to make crude picks and axes from knapped stone, anvils from boulders, backpacks from bags (that you can find in any human hamlet), and "emergency" crutches from bone.
		All adventure mode reactions use the knapping skill.
	
	User/Archery:
		Adds the archers workshop, a building where you can make all types of ranged weapons and their ammo.
		The only thing you cannot do (yet) is make ranged weapons from metal, you will have to use bone or wood for now.
		To keep the ammo reaction count under control ammo creation is done in two steps, first you make "shafts" out of the desired material, then you turn the shafts into ammo of the desired type.

	User/Block/Boulder:
		For the OCD among us, I present the boulder press. The boulder press allows you to recolor boulders via the wonders of dwarven masonry. 
		How does it work? I have no idea, but dwarven masons are renowned for their ability to do strange things with stone :)
		Like the other shops of it's kind the boulder press allows you to spend twice as much to get a better quality product.
		Fine boulders are not only worth more, but magma safe as well.
	
	User/Block/Cutter:
		The block cutter allows you to harness the wonderful power of dwarven masonry to cut 4 blocks of any color from 1 hard non-economic boulder of any kind. If you want to make higher value constructions you can also cut a boulder into 2 better quality blocks instead.
		Fine blocks are not only worth more, but magma safe as well.
	
	User/Block/Kiln:
		The Block Kiln works exactly like the block cutter except that you fire blocks from clay instead of cutting them from boulders. 5 clay gets you 10 normal blocks or 5 fine blocks.
		Fine blocks are not only worth more, but magma safe as well.
	
	User/Bone Flux:
		Bake bones at the kiln to make calcite, a flux stone.
		Very useful for steel making in flux-poor locations.
	
	User/Bonecarver:
		Adds a workshop for advanced shaping of bone, allows you to make basic furniture and some items from your choice of bone or a fake "bone" stone (to allow better stockpiling).
		Blocks may also be made from a fire safe "treated bone" material, this makes item-less embarks a little less dependent upon caravans.
	
	User/Bonfire:
		Start a fire and burn them goblins! Either start a short wood fueled fire or start a longer coke fueled one.
		Good for starting brush fires or burning trash.
	
	User/Building Dimensions:
		Append all building names with their dimensions, really simple.
	
	User/Cast Anvil:
		Gives playable races a reaction to cast an iron anvil from 5 iron bars.
	
	User/Cat Damper:
		Removes ADOPTS_OWNER and RETURNS_VERMIN_KILLS_TO_OWNER from the cat, preventing catsplosion and widespread miasma.
	
	User/Cave Color:
		Changes color and availability of cave "grasses". Level 1 is green, yellow and brown, level 2 is mostly blue and cyan, and level 3 is red and gray. 
		Changes are cosmetic only. Does not change non-grass plants or trees.
		Makes it easy to tell which cavern level you are looking at.
	
	User/Decorations/Display Case:
		Adds a useless workshop that can be built with 1 block and any 1 other item, build with an artifact to make room value skyrocket or just use to keep things out of reach of those pesky thieves.
	
	User/Decorations/Display Case/DFHack:
		Gives the display case a pretty custom sidebar menu that displays the contained item.
		The script used is a direct, unchanged, copy of the one from the DFHack r5 mini-mod pack.
	
	User/DFHack/Cart Filler:
		Fill minecarts with water or magma (without big fancy mechanical contraptions).
		To access fluids the filler needs to be adjacent to a downward passable tile leading to a cistern!
		To fill a minecart it needs to be adjacent to or on top of the filler, the minecart is NOT used as a reagent in the reaction. The best way to use the filler is to place it next to a minecart stop (or stops) and a cistern, this allows you to fill minecarts and send them on their way with a minimum of fuss.
		The amount of liquid used is determined by the minecart capacity, but at least 4/7 fluid is needed for the filler to function at all.
		Uses the pump operator skill (to fill carts) and mechanics (to build the filler).
	
	User/DFHack/Cart Filler/Powered:
		An automatic mechanically powered version of the "DFHack/Cart Filler" addon.
		This addon works exactly the same with these additional rules (which are evaluated in order):
			If both magma and a magma safe minecart are present magma is loaded
			If any minecart and water is present water is loaded
			If magma is present and the only minecart(s) are not magma safe an announcement is printed
			If no minecarts are present nothing happens
			If no fluids are present an announcement is printed
		(If these rules cause announcement spam they may need to be changed)
	
	User/DFHack/Dragon Engine:
		A direct port of the dragon engines from the DFHack r5 mini-mod pack.
		Dragon engines are basically machines that take magma and spit it out as dragon fire, very deadly short range siege engines.
	
	User/DFHack/Fill Barrel:
		Fill barrels from nearby water at the still, works like the cart filler as far as finding the water goes.
		Also allows you to fill water buckets for use in the hospital.
		This addon is most for use in biomes where water freezes in the winter (so you can have water reserves).
		Please note that AFAIK water barrels are not stockpilable.
		Note that unlike most DFHack addons this one will still work without DFHack, it just won't require/use water.
		Why the still? Well the water needs to be purified somewhere right?
	
	User/DFHack/Magma/Extractor:
		Extract minerals from magma, get all kinds of rare and valuable metals! (but only rarely)
		A magma extractor can be very profitable, provided you can feed it enough magma.
		Each cycle uses 2/7 magma and at least 4/7 magma needs to be available.
		Uses the furnace operator skill.
	
	User/DFHack/Magma/Extractor/Powered:
		An automatic powered version of the "DFHack/Magma/Extractor" addon.
		This addon works exactly the same as "DFHack/Magma/Extractor", just without dwarf labor.
	
	User/DFHack/Magma/Melter:
		Melt rocks into magma! 
		The magma is put into an adjacent magma-safe minecart or an adjacent cistern.
		When using minecarts this works exactly like the magma cart filler, when using a cistern it will attempt to spawn magma into any open space below an adjacent downward passable tile.
		DO NOT BUILD THIS BUILDING NEXT TO YOUR MAIN STAIRWELL!
		It is possible to enable magma workshops/furnaces here as well, so if you don't have a volcano there is no need to dig to the magma sea if you don't wish to.
		Uses the furnace operator skill.
	
	User/DFHack/Obsidian Caster:
		The obsidian caster makes obsidian boulders directly from adjacent water and magma, which needs to be on the level below and accessible via downward passable tiles.
		4/7 water and magma are used for every boulder (so clever engineers can still be more efficient).
		Uses the pump operator skill (to operate) and mechanics (to build the caster).
	
	User/DFHack/Obsidian Caster/Powered:
		An automatic powered version of the "DFHack/Obsidian Caster" addon.
		This addon works exactly the same as "DFHack/Obsidian Caster", just without dwarf labor.
	
	User/Diggable Slade:
		Allows you to dig slade, once you get past it's guardians that is...
		Digging slade may lead to bugs, so be careful.
	
	User/Dwarf/Castes:
		Adds more dwarf castes.
		See the entry in "Rubble Addon Extras.txt" for more details, including descriptions and detailed population ratios.
	
	User/Dwarf/Castes/DFHack/Transform:
		Allows you to change the caste of your dwarves at the guild hall for a nominal fee.
		Most caste changes cost 500 gold, but warriors and priests cost more.
		Requires the "User/Dwarf/Castes" addon.
	
	User/Edible Vermin:
		Allows you to cook vermin at the kitchen to get cheap meat, a good emergency food source.
		(urist likes vermin for their great taste.)
	
	User/Factory:
		Adds a large factory building for making batches of cheap items (mostly from wood and stone).
		Allows you to make all kinds of furniture as well as sets of clothing, batches of weapons, and sets of armor.
		All factory reactions are just a little bit cheaper than the vanilla version.
		All factory items that can be made from stone and wood also have a version that can be made from blocks or planks, save even more resources!
		Uses various skills.
	
	User/Fix/Butcher Inorganic:
		Allows you to butcher creatures made from (some) inorganics, FB stone walls anyone?
		(Not 100% sure this works, copied from Modest Mod)
	
	User/Fix/Fish Pops:
		Raises fish vermin populations to the max.
		This should stop you from fishing out a lake or ocean ever again! (unless you catch ~30,000 fish...)
	
	User/Fix/Gays:
		Makes humans and dwarves have a strictly straight orientation.
		The list of creatures can be modified via config variable, but this should only be done with care, as indiscriminate modification of the variable in question may clobber changes made by other addons (this is not an issue with the default addons).
		For details on how to modify the creature list see the comments in this addon's script.
	
	User/Fix/Human Diplomats:
		Adds trade representatives and diplomats to the humans.
	
	User/Fix/Undead Melt:
		Fixes bad temperature values in material_template_default.
		I think all bad values are fixed, but this addon has not received extensive testing!.
		In any case this should make it possible to melt undead with magma.
	
	User/Fix/Usable Chitin:
		Allows you to use chitin as shell.
	
	User/Fix/Usable Feathers:
		Allows you to use feathers as "soft" pearls (you can use them to make crafts).
	
	User/Fix/Usable Scale:
		Allows you to use scale like leather.
	
	User/Fix/Vermin Variations:
		This adds two fixes:
			Forces all giant animals to have a life span of at least 10 years and
			Replaces all pool biome tags in giant and animal-man creatures with the correct lake biome.
		This is useful to make variations on vermin appear in game and to help them live long enough to be interesting.
	
	User/Fix/Whips:
		Nerfs whips and scourges so they are not deadly anti-armor weapons.
		
	User/Generic Animal Mats:
		The addons in this group all make some animal materials generic.
		Each addon handles a different group of materials, who handles what is easy to tell from the addon names (I won't make a full list here).
		Not all animal materials are handled, for example silk is not touched in any way, but most common materials are handled.
	
	User/Glass Forge:
		The glass forge allows you to make armor and weapons from all three kinds of glass.
		Green glass is a little under iron grade, clear glass is equivalent to iron, and crystal glass is a little under steel.
		If you melt down glass items you will get "bars" of glass, you can melt these bars back to raw glass if you wish, or you can use them at the forge to make other glass items. If you wish you can also make bars directly from raw glass.
	
	User/Lamination:
		Glue wooden planks together to make laminated logs, which are more valuable than most generic woods.
		Uses the alchemy skill.
	
	User/Metallurgy:
		Adds an "Alloy Furnace" that can be used to make alloys.
		All alloys are made from bars using the smelting skill. Does not effect the smelter in any way.
	
	User/Metallurgy/Bloomery:
		Adds a "Bloomery" that can be used to make iron and steel in a more realistic manner.
		This completely replaces vanilla iron and steel production.
		Sadly this required removing the metal ore tags from iron ores (which breaks the metal ore embark indicator and ore stockpiles).
		This addon is loosely based on parts of the Realistic 14th Century Metallurgy Mod.
		To refine iron or make steel you need to make a bloom and hammer impurities out of it multiple times, if you have flux you can cut the time required in half and save some fuel (by skipping the first two hammer steps).
		Blooms will self destruct in a few weeks, so you need to keep on top of the process.
		Cost Table:
			Iron ore -> 4 bars (no flux): 4.25 fuel per bar, 0 with magma, 4.25 steps per bar
			Iron ore -> 4 bars (with flux): 2.25 fuel per bar, 0 with magma, 2.25 steps per bar
			Iron bar -> steel bar (no flux): 6 fuel per bar, 1 with magma, 5 steps per bar
			Iron bar -> steel bar (with flux): 4 fuel per bar, 1 with magma, 3 steps per bar
		For consistency I suggest using this addon together with "User/Metallurgy/Smelter".
	
	User/Metallurgy/DFHack/Volcanic:
		Made from a mix of metals carefully steeped in specially prepared magma, volcanic metal has some very odd properties. Volcanic metal is always slightly warm to the touch and is very heavy, it is also far stronger than its components. 
		Volcanic metal is made from platinum and iron in roughly equal parts (plus lots of magma).
		Note that this reaction is only possible at the magma version of the alloy furnace and that it USES UP 4/7 magma!
		Requires the "User/Metallurgy" Addon.
	
	User/Metallurgy/Mithril:
		Stretch your precious Adamantine supply, make mithril.
		Mithril is a very light and sharp alloy that is made from steel and aluminum with a small admixture of adamantine, thereby greatly extending your adamantine supply (at the cost of slightly worse performance). 
		Mithril is a little better than steel grade plus it is lighter and sharper.
		Requires the "User/Metallurgy" Addon.
	
	User/Metallurgy/Smelter:
		Replaces the default ore smelting reactions with a better set.
		Unfortunately this addon completely breaks the metal ore embark indicator and stockpiles (use economic stone stockpiles instead)
		Galena and tetrahedrite may only be smelted to one metal at a time, so you need to decide which metal is more important to your needs.
	
	User/Metallurgy/Smelter/Remove Alloys:
		Removes all the vanilla alloy reactions, it is not a good idea to use this without "User/Metallurgy"!
	
	User/Pottery:
		Replace the vanilla pottery system with a much expanded version. 
		Glazing is still done the same basic way as vanilla (unless "User/Pottery/Glaze" is installed, then it is MUCH better). Unlike vanilla there is not a glazing reaction for each item type, use stockpiles to restrict item usage.
	
	User/Pottery/Batch:
		Adds a batch kiln that can make 5x the stuff with 4x the material and 1x the fuel.
		Like the normal kiln addon you can make many, many, more things from clay than you can make in vanilla.
		Glazing and collecting clay can only be done at the normal kiln.
	
	User/Pottery/Glaze:
		Allows you to grind minerals and ores into glaze powders of various colors and then use these powders to glaze various items. Unlike vanilla there is not a glazing reaction for each item type, use stockpiles to restrict item usage.
		Each mineral or ore boulder is ground into 10 units of glaze powder, ash bars only produce 3 units.
		There are four different kinds of glazing you may do:
			Ash glazing uses one unit of ash to glaze an item, simple and cheap.
			Monochrome glazing uses two units of any color glaze to glaze an item.
			Dichrome glazing uses one unit of white glaze and one unit of any other color to glaze an item, this is more valuable than monochrome and has an additional chance of having bands on the item for even more value.
			Polychrome glazing uses one unit of white and one unit each of blue, red, and yellow glaze to glaze an item, like dichrome this adds lots of value and each non-white color has a chance of adding bands. If you get lucky your simple pot could become very valuable!
		Glaze List:
			Name									Color Class		Value
			olive ash glaze							ash				3
			cream white tin glaze					white			10
			pearl white zinc glaze					white			10
			silver glaze							white			15
			gold glaze								yellow			20
			turquoise green copper glaze			blue			10
			rust red iron glaze						red				15
			chartreuse green nickel glaze			blue			10
			scarlet red lead glaze					red				10
			vermilion cinnabar glaze				red				6
			cobalt blue glaze						blue			6
			saffron yellow orpiment glaze			yellow			6
			lemon yellow antimony glaze				yellow			6
			dark indigo manganese glaze				blue			6
			orange radiant pitchblende glaze		red				6
		This addon is a polished and Rubblized port of the old "Expanded Glazes" mod by "NW_Kohaku". This version has had the reactions completely reworked as well as a few other balancing changes.
	
	User/Pottery/Porcelain:
		Allows you to use orthoclase and microcline to make porcelain (in addition to kaolinite).
		I am not sure how realistic this is, orthoclase and microcline are used to make porcelain, but it may only be as an additive, not the main ingredient.
	
	User/Quarry:
		Dig for some basic raw materials without needing to actually dig.
		There are two types of quarry:
			Quarry: 8 blocks, 4 mechanisms, 2 giant corkscrews, 10x10
				Dig for clay; 100% chance of a clay boulder, 10% chance of additional fire clay boulder
				Dig for sand; 100% chance for a bag of sand
				Dig for stone; 2% chance for 12 different layer stones
			Makeshift Quarry, free, 5x5
				Dig for clay; 20% chance of a clay boulder
				Dig for sand; 20% chance for a bag of sand
		You can use a quarry to dig for resources that do not exist in your current fort, so if you use quarries you never need to worry if you proposed embark has sand or clay.
		Uses the pump operator skill.
	
	User/Research:
		Build a laboratory and research advanced workshops.
		Handles the research class "RESEARCH_GENERIC", which is used by many of the default addons.
		You may also copy any research discovery here (for free). Uses the alchemy skill.
	
	User/Saurian:
		A new race to play as, see the Saurian guide in "Rubble Addon Extras.txt" for more details.
		This addon only includes the saurian creature and entity as well as saurian sized weapons and some basic reactions. Nothing else is included.
		It is HIGHLY recommended to activate at least the "User/Quarry", "User/Glass Forge", "User/Sawmill", "User/Warcrafter" and "User/Pottery" addons.
		To dig as saurians you need to buy a pick and resize it at the craftsaurian.
		If this addon is activated dwarves are unplayable and the dwarven outpost liaison becomes a trade rep (unless you activate "Saurian/Unplayable").
		Requires the "Glass Forge" addon.
	
	User/Saurian/Castes:
		Adds some basic castes to the saurians.
		See the saurian guide for details.
		Requires the "User/Saurian" addon.
	
	User/Saurian/Castes/DFHack/Transform:
		Allows you to change the caste of your saurians at the new meditation circle workshop.
		Meditating takes from 1/2 to 3 seasons (depending on what the result caste is).
		Requires the "User/Saurian" and "User/Saurian/Basic Castes" addons.
	
	User/Saurian/Unplayable:
		If you just want saurians as an extra race to trade with the dwarves, activate this addon.
		Requires the "User/Saurian" addon.
	
	User/Sawmill:
		Farmable wood plants and advanced wood processing, makes aboveground and/or treeless forts a lot easier.
		If you wish you can scrap most wooden items (at a small loss), good for getting rid of all that elf crap you took from the last caravan :)
		The sawmill uses the carpentry and wood burning skills for its reactions.
		Don't forget a serrated disk!
		There are two kinds of farmable wood plants:
			Name			Biome			Growth Time		Log Color	Notes
			lumber bamboo	non freezing	1/2 year		Brown		Edible seeds
			stalkshroom		caves lvl 1-2	1 year			Dark Gray	Heavy and slightly more valuable
	
	User/Smoked Meat:
		Allows you to smoke meat at the kitchen to preserve it (inedible to vermin and will not rot).
		Does not improve value.
	
	User/Tanning:
		Makes creatures give skin "globs" instead of "skins" when butchered, this allows large animals to produce more than one piece of leather once tanned. 
		If "User/Fix/Usable Scale" is activated then scale is changed as well.
		Based on a mod/modders resource by sackhead.
	
	User/Tileset/MLC/DFHack/TWBT:
		A simple addon that installs my custom ASCII-like tileset.
		This version uses the "Text Will Be Text" DFHack plugin (you will need to install that plugin separately).
		Unlike most ASCII tilesets this one has special tiles for most buildings and items, making it (almost) fully graphical.
		Comes only in the 16x16 size.
		This addon makes no raw changes, so it should be usable with all ASCII compatible mods.
	
	User/Tileset/MLC/Normal:
		A simple addon that installs my custom ASCII-like tileset.
		This version is very close to default ASCII (a few tiles are graphical).
		Comes in two sizes, a 16x16 for fullscreen mode and a 10x10 for windowed mode.
		This addon makes no raw changes, so it should be usable with all ASCII compatible mods.
	
	User/Tileset/MLC/Pure ASCII:
		A simple addon that installs my custom ASCII-like tileset.
		This version has absolutely no graphical tiles.
		Comes in two sizes, a 16x16 for fullscreen mode and a 10x10 for windowed mode.
		This addon makes no raw changes, so it should be usable with all ASCII compatible mods.
	
	User/Tileset/Vanilla:
		Restores the vanilla tileset related init options.
		It is a very good idea to use this addon whenever you are using the vanilla tileset, as otherwise prepping worlds generated from those raws may not work quite right.
		This addon makes no raw changes, so it should be usable with all ASCII compatible mods.
	
	User/Tileset/Vanilla/Graphics:
		The vanilla creature graphics, mostly just a demo.
	
	User/Training:
		Make ink from ash, and paper from wood, then make a book from paper and ink and read it for exp in your chosen skill.
		Note that EVERY skill in the game can be trained this way, even the useless ones ;). Making books uses the Alchemy skill.
		Note that skills that do not have a labor appear to allow ANYONE to do the reaction, use workshop profiles.
	
	User/Warcrafter:
		A special workshop for all your early game armor and ammo needs, the warcrafter allows you to make:
			Scalemail armor from leather, bone, and shell
			Bolts and arrows from bone and shell
			Heavy cloaks from leather
			Green glass weapons and armor (if the "User/Glass Forge" addon is active)
		Making bone and shell items requires you to cut them into "scales" first.
	
	User/Warcrafter/Adventure:
		Adds a bunch of adventure mode reactions, mostly for making use of bones and skin (via bone and leather items, mostly armor but also a few other useful things including a few bone weapons)
		This addon is mostly for those who do not wish to use the advfort DFHack script, but still want to do some basic crafting.
		Supports "User/Tanning" and "User/Fix/Usable Scale", but a DF bug keeps the support for "User/Tanning" from working correctly, it works but it requires lots of hunting to get much leather (the tanning reaction always takes two stacks of skin, and produces one tanned hide no matter how large the stacks are, so "User/Tanning" actually REDUCES the hide output in adventure mode).
		Requires "User/Warcrafter" (for the armor items and materials).
	
	User/Wicker:
		Make all sorts of stuff from woven plants. Uses the process plants skill (for bundling) and weaving (for making stuff).
	
	User/Zap Aquifers:
		Disables all AQUIFER tags, very simple.
