User/Saurians

==============================================
Saurians Overview:
==============================================

Saurians are a small (size 20000) reptilian race of swamp dwellers with mildly venomous bites (causes pain).
Saurians cannot dig at embark, but if a pick were to be bought (and resized to fit smaller hands) digging, even down to the magma sea and below, should be possible.

While saurians are not very tough, they are FAST little buggers and can quickly run down and kill foes many times their size with the proper equipment and training, often before the enemy can get a blow in. Of course if the enemy CAN get a blow in the saurian is often in trouble!
In keeping with their small size and speed saurian armor tends to be tough and light.

It is generally assumed that you will activate at least the "User/Quarry", "User/Sawmill", "User/Glass Forge", "User/Warcrafter" and "User/Pottery" addons when playing saurians, as saurians may lack industries without at least those addons.

While saurians can dig just like dwarves, they cannot make picks. This means that if you want to do any mining you will need to buy a pick from the dwarves or humans. 
Don't plan on doing any digging until late in the second or third year (or even later). 
When you do finally get a pick you will find that saurians learn the mining skill VERY slowly, so don't plan on having a huge underground fortress.
This tends to make a sawmill critical to your early survival, as you will need lots of wood blocks and/or charcoal depending on whether you want to build your fort out of masonry, glass, or wood blocks. 
Clay for pottery may be difficult to get without digging, use a quarry to ensure your supply.

You will not get a caravan until spring of the second year! This may make difficult embarks a little more Fun.

If you do not want to divert pottery/carpentry capacity to making furniture, wicker can make a good replacement so long as you can gather/grow enough plants, plus if you use bins, wicker is a perfect bin material as it is really light.

All saurians have natural skill (level 2) in bite, kick, punch, and fighter.

==============================================
Saurian Castes:
==============================================
	
	If you install the "User/Saurian/Basic Castes" addon you will get a few more saurian castes to play around with.
	In addition "User/Saurian/Basic Castes/DFHack/Transform" allows you to change a saurian's caste at the cost of large amounts of time (up to 3/4 of a year to train a shaman).

Saurian Tips:
==============================================
	Use hunters.
		Saurians are good hunters and so long as your arrows hold out you can get large amounts of good cheap food without having to worry about diverting farm space. The other animal products gathered are just as valuable, leather is one of the components for the better armor materials and bone makes a good source of hunting/training arrows. In late/mid game hunters can become valuable additions to your military as snipers.
	
	Pay attention to your saurian's castes.
		You can of course just assign anyone to anything but if you try to make sure you match jobs to caste bonuses you can get that extra little bit of performance that can sometimes make a big difference. For example shaman caste saurians make good support troops or doctors but would be wasted as farmers or crafters.
	
	Start a lumber bamboo farm as soon as (or before) you have a sawmill.
		It's hard to see the need for a lumber bamboo farm in the early game (after clear cutting the entire surface of the map for the second or third time you should have hundreds of logs), but you need wood for fuel, building, furniture, and mechanisms, it really doesn't take long to run out. Lumber bamboo farms are low maintenance, so just make a huge farm plot somewhere and start planting.
	
	Buy rare items like gems, silk and stone ASAP (unless you like failed moods).
		If you need raw gems you can "uncut" large gems you trade for at the craftsaurian's workshop, if you need cut gems you can use glass. Stone boulders can be pressed from blocks at the craftsaurian's workshop, fired from clay at the kiln and batch kiln, or dug up at a quarry. Silk cloth is (generally) only available from trade, if you get lucky and have some aboveground web vermin in the area pen up the cats!
	
	Use glass!
		On most maps glass will make a good, renewable, source of valuable and useful goods. Glass can also be made into rather good weapons and armor (crystal glass is almost as good as steel and clear glass is just as good as iron).
		If you use the "User/Research" addon don't forget that if you use the "User/Warcrafter" addon you can make green glass items without needing to research the glass forge!
	
	Don't forget metal!
		It takes a LONG time to train a smith, but for the absolute best weapons and armor there is no substitute for steel and adamantine.
		One shortcut to keep in mind: If you can train several saurians to be novice armor or weapon smiths you may get a legendary smith from a mood if you wait long enough...

Saurian Recommended Addon List:
==============================================

Saurians have very little in the way of built-in industries, so you will want to activate some of the other addons to flesh them out some.
Here is a list of the ones I think most important:
	User/Block/Bone
	User/Block/Kiln
	User/Bone Flux
	User/Fix/Fish Pops
	User/Glass Forge
	User/Lamination

	User/Pottery/Batch
	User/Pottery/Glaze
	User/Quarry
	User/Sawmill
	User/Tanning
	User/Warcrafter

Some of the other addons are very useful as well, these are just the ones that are too useful to leave out.

==============================================
Saurian Item-less Embark Plan:
==============================================

Required addons:
	User/Block/Bone
	User/Glass Forge
	User/Quarry
	User/Warcrafter

Start gathering plants, you need some rope reeds for later and this step can take a while (plus you need the food). 
If you want, build a makeshift quarry and start mining clay, you will need the quarry for later and clay is always useful.
Deconstruct your wagon.
Build a butcher shop and butcher one of your wagon pullers, you need a stack of bones.
Deconstruct your butcher shop and build a craftsaurian's workshop.
Make a units of 2 treated bone blocks at the craftsaurian's workshop.
Use your treated blocks to build a glass furnace and wood furnace.
Make two units of charcoal.
Deconstruct your wood furnace.
By now you should have some rope reeds, build a farmers workshop and spin some thread.
Deconstruct your farmers workshop and build a loom.
Weave at least one unit of cloth and then deconstruct your loom.
Build a clothier and make one or more bags, deconstruct the clothier.
Dig for sand at your makeshift quarry until you get a bag full.
Make a hunk of raw green glass at your glass furnace.
Build a Warcrafter and make a small green glass axe.
Now on to your regularly scheduled program... (Wooden training axes are for wusses!)
