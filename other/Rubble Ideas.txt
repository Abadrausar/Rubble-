
If I don't write it down I forget it, hence this file.
If you see something nice in here that you want to use with your mod feel free to steal it :)

Finish the powered logic gates and sensors
	Test the proof-of-concept addon, in particular switchable levers is all new (and likely broken).
	Gates:
		AND
		OR
		NOT
		XOR
	Sensors:
		Item (settable min/max count)
		Unit (variants for pets and hostiles?)
		Cart (settable cargo thresholds)
		(others?)
	Other:
		Repeater (wait y ticks, turn on, wait x ticks, turn off, repeat)
		Clock (trigger for x ticks at a certain time of year)

Succession fort tools:
	A special "succession mode":
		Batch generate a special raw set that supports multiple tilesets (via raw switching)
			You choose your addons, then choose tileset addons, one raw set is generated per tileset addon
	A tileset switcher utility (using the already generated raw sets)

Crystal Thorn
	A slow growing (but not too slow!) farmable plant that has two uses:
		It may be processed to a low value raw gem
		It may be ground into sand
	~4 plants for each gem or 1 plant per unit of sand
		Processing to gems will require a custom reaction, milling to sand can probably use the vanilla system
		By using vanilla milling nothing special needs to be done to make them work with the powered mill addon

Port the old "BD/Farming/Basics", but with faster plant growth.
	The old addon was too hard (extra slow plant growth + complicated processing = starve).
		If plants grow too slowly they will not be able to compete with other ways to get food.
	Should I support the new "garden" plants or should they be removed?
		I am inclined to remove most of them, but expand the list of plants from the old version.
	Add more "special" plants (like the above idea), make sure there are several plants for each niche, etc.
		Some plants should be similar, but with different processing and/or byproducts
			For example several oil plants, some fast growing, but producing a cheap toxic oil (good only for soap) and some slow growing, but capable of producing an edible oil that can be cooked OR made into soap.
			Another example would be berries, they can be eaten or brewed, while some other plants may be ground then pressed, to provide both food AND drink from the same plant.
	Now that I have a good system for config vars variable difficulty is possible...

A powered screw press.
	May be difficult, I may have to make this one less flexible than I would like.
	[HAS_MATERIAL_REACTION_PRODUCT:HONEYCOMB_PRESS_MAT] (unpressed honeycomb tools only)
	[HAS_MATERIAL_REACTION_PRODUCT:PRESS_LIQUID_MAT] (unpressed globs and plant growths only)
	Press to jugs:
		[EMPTY]
		[DOES_NOT_ABSORB]
		[HAS_TOOL_USE:LIQUID_CONTAINER]

Support milling items to paste at the powered mill
	Vanilla uses [HAS_MATERIAL_REACTION_PRODUCT:PRESS_LIQUID_MAT], but only for seed items
		This will need to be extendable by other addons.

Port the "BD/Hives" addons.
	All of them require a good bit of reworking.
		The spider addon is designed for use with Essential DF (uses creatures that do not exist in vanilla)
		The rainbow beetle dyes desperately need to be changed (color names do not match dye descriptions)

Rework the saurian nobles

Make the unpowered quarry require soil (if DFHack is available)

Gem forge
	Create armor, weapons, furniture, tools, etc from gems
	Probably requires a new material template for all gems (to make them sharp and hard)
	Mostly gems should make good edged weapons, but poor armor
	mostly decorative, good for nobles and fancy stuff like that (but gem swords may make a good early weapon)
