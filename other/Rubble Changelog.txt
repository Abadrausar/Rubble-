Changelog:
==============================================
v4.4 (for DF 40.8)
	Updated the "Base" addon to DF 40.8
	All addons in the "Libs" group are now automatically activated if needed.
	Changed all addons that use bones to use more realistic amounts.
	Added "User/DFHack/Fill Barrel", fill barrels and buckets with water at the still.
	Added "User/Metallurgy", better access to alloys.
	Added "User/Metallurgy/Mithril", a new high performance weapons grade alloy (great for blades and armor).
	Added "User/Metallurgy/DFHack/Volcanic", a new high performance weapons grade alloy (great for hammers and maces).
	Added "User/Metallurgy/Bloomery", more realistic iron and steel production.
	Added "User/Metallurgy/Smelter", more realistic (and more streamlined) smelting.
	Added "User/Metallurgy/Smelter/Remove Alloys", remove the alloy reactions from the smelter.
	Added "User/Fix/Gays", by default this only fixes humans and dwarves.
		The list of creatures to fix can be modified via config variable, see the script header for details.
	Added "User/Smoked Meat", dwarven emergency rations!
	Removed "User/Block/Bone".
	Added "User/Bonecarver", finally, bone furniture (as well as blocks, crafts, and a few other items).
	Saurians are now strictly "straight".
	Removed "User/Add CHILD Tags" as it is no longer needed.
	AXIS VFS has been updated to the latest version, this change is fully backwards compatible.
	Rex (specifically the GenII sub-system) has been updated, this allows extended capabilities for a few script variables.
	The scripting subsystem initialization now takes place in two stages.
		This will allow scripts to be run (with slightly reduced functionality) immediately after Rubble starts.
	The way file type is handled internally has changed significantly (the new system is more flexible).
	Added a new type of script: loader scripts run immediately after the addon activation finishes.
		Loader scripts allow you to do things like load patches and modify addon state before the file list is generated.
		Like init scripts loader scripts are run even if their containing addon is not active or loaded.
	The rubble:activate_addon and rubble:add_file script commands have been removed.
		Loader scripts are more flexible and less error-prone, so this hack is no longer required.
	The "Libs/Base" and "Libs/Castes" addons are now forced active via loader script.
		This is far better than the old way as the addons in question are truly active.
	The way addons are activated (internally) has changed slightly to allow loader scripts to run at the most useful time.
	Some of the standard user script commands have been moved to a loader script (dependency checks mostly).
	Added a new standard user script command to fetch addons by name for use with loader scripts: rubble:fetchaddon.
	Added a new standard user script command to force an addon active: rubble:activateaddon.
		If the addon does not exist an nicely formated error message is printed.
	Added a new native script command: rubble:patch, allows applying patches to strings.
		Patch support is almost certainly buggy! What I tested worked, but I only tested the simplest uses.
	Added two new naive commands for making "virtual addons": rubble:newaddon and rubble:newfile.
		This commands allow you to create new addons in loader scripts.
	Added a new native script command: rubble:filetag, allows reading and editing file tags.

v4.3 (for DF 40.5)
	Fixed "User/Fix/Human Diplomats", two small bugs bugs in it's script kept it from working.
	Fixed "User/Cat Damper", I really should test these things better.
	Split the readme into several parts.
	Split "User/Generic Animal Mats" into many little addons, change only the stuff you want to!
	Made the "User/Block" addons have less redundant content, this change should not affect users.
	Fixed an error that kept rubble:groupactive from working.

v4.2 (for DF 40.5)
	Updated the "Base" addon to 40.5.
	Removed "User/Nerf/Ranged" (it's changes are now part of vanilla!).
	Moved "User/Nerf/Whips" to "User/Fix/Whips".
	Added "User/Generic Animal Mats", generic animal materials for all!
	Tweaked the DFHack support a little.
	Removed "Libs/DFHack/Spawn", as 40.x DFHack will come with a unit spawn script there is no need for it.
	Added "User/Cat Damper", slightly less annoying cats.
	Added "User/Fix/Human Diplomats", adds trade reps and diplomats to the humans.

v4.1 (for DF 40.3)
	Added "Libs/Research", library support for a research reaction system.
	Moved all "user" addons to the "User" group.
	Added a bunch of addons from Better Dorfs (all were put into the "User" group).
	Added "User/Warcrafter/Adventure", non-DFHack adventure mode crafting.
	Reworked the DFHack support templates in "Libs/Base", they should be all ready to go now.
	Removed "Libs/DFHack/Command".
		Use DFHACK_REACTION or DFHACK_REACTION_BIND (from "Libs/Base") instead, they have radically
		different syntax and usage, but they use the new reaction binding script (which is much
		better than the old autoSyndrome method).
	The REACTION template did not work exactly as documented, now it does.
		This caused a minor loss of functionality (which wasn't used anywhere anyway) for a great
		gain in simplicity.
	Updated the tileset templates to handle the new tree related init settings.
	Removed support for "Libs/DFHack/Command" from "Libs/DFHack/Fluids".
	In the "Base" addon the dwarf creature now has the caste templates for "Libs/Castes" support.
	"Libs/Castes" is now forced active during normal generation cycles.
	Updated "Libs/DFHack/Announcement" to use the new DFHack system.
	Updated "Libs/DFHack/Spawn" to use the new DFHack system.
	Added "User/Tilesets/MLC/Pure ASCII", a version of my tileset that has no graphical tiles.
	Removed the rubble:activeaddons script variable, it was only used once, and that was easy to replace.
	Added script command rubble:add_file, add a file after generation starts (experts only!).
		This is mostly to make patches possible, most users will have no use for this command.

v4.0 (for DF 40.3)
	First public release for the 4.x series.
	Replaced "Base" with a base made from the raws for DF 40.3.
	While the DFHack library addons were not removed do not assume that they will work with DFHack for DF2014.
		In particular anything that needs "Libs/DFHack/Command" probably won't work.
		"Libs/Caste/DFHack/Transform" will probably work just fine as will "Libs/DFHack/Add Reaction".

v4pre (for DF 34.11, changes from Rubble 3.13)
	Changed scripting subsystems from Raptor to Rex.
		Rex is a little less flexible but ultimately faster and more powerful scripting language loosely based on Raptor.
		Many, many things have changed, but only a few of them really make a big difference:
			Some commands like set, var, command, and namespace are replaced by new syntax constructs.
			Code is "compiled" to a much lower form, allowing for faster execution.
			A lot of the more "dynamic" stuff from Raptor is gone:
				It is not possible to use a string as code (directly, eval still works).
				Some commands require code blocks to have variables "predeclared" via a special block declaration syntax.
					This replaces many uses of the old params array with a much clearer, less error-prone syntax.
				The various advanced eval commands are gone.
			You may now use single quotes (') and back quotes (`) as string delimiters.
		See the files in the "Rex Docs" folder for more info
	As a direct result of the change in scripting subsystems Rubble is now MUCH faster.
	More internal data is exported to scripts (via GenII, so be careful!).
	Some native commands have been ported to init scripts.
	Fixed lots of little scripting bugs that were discovered when porting.
	Removed the builtin templates !SCRIPT, SCRIPT, and #SCRIPT.
	Added a new base template: @SCRIPT.
	The !SCRIPT_TEMPLATE builtin template was removed, use the rubble:template script command.
	The syntax of the rubble:template command has changed significantly (it's simpler in some ways).
	Removed shell mode, it was useful, but ultimately added much complexity for small gain.
	Removed the lexer test. This was an internal debugging utility that has outlived it's usefulness.
	Removed the "Shared Animal Mats" addon, as it is too fragile for inclusion with Rubble.
	Added "Fix/Fish Pops", raises all fish population to the max, never fish out an area again.
	Fixed rare case where the addon list would not update.
	The script raw parser has moved from the "raw" module to the "df:raw" module.
		The parser has been simplified and is joined by a slow, but more flexible cousin.
	Added "Dev/Tileset/Export", automatically extract tile info from raws that have the Rubble tileset templates.
	Added "Dev/Tileset/Insert", automatically inserts Rubble tileset templates into untemplated raws.
	Removed the #WRITE_TILESET template, it is now obsolete.
	Removed support for anonymous template parameters (eg %1) as this was never useful, and has become less so over time.
	The "outputdir" setting has changed, it is now the path to the "raw" directory, not "raw/objects".
	Renamed "Tilesets/MLC" to "Tilesets/MLC/Normal".
	Added "Tilesets/MLC/Tracks", A version of the MLC tileset that has graphical tracks.
	Added "Tilesets/MLC/DFHack/TWBT", A version of the MLC tileset for use with Text Will Be Text.
	The addon loader no longer writes every addon and file name to the log, all this did was bloat the log for no good reason.
	It is now possible to specify -config or -addons more than once, this applies to rubble.ini as well.
		Each occurrence is parsed separately, but the results are added together.
	Added the ability to pass a file name to -config, in that case the config variables will be read from the file.
	Added the ability to pass a file name to -addons, in that case the file is treated as an addon list file.
	Removed live profiling, it is normally really nice to have, but Rubble completes too fast for it to be usable.
	Made sure Rubble always exits with code 1 when it does not complete properly.
	Made sure Rubble prints "Done." as the last thing when it succeeds.
	Finally got it so that ALL native script command documentation is automatically generated.
		The script documents should never go out of sync now (user command docs are still done by hand though).
	Rubble now prefixes all parsed files with a short message stating that the file was automatically generated.
		This message also includes the source path (uses the AXIS syntax).
	Added new addon, "Building Dimensions": Append all building names with their dimensions.
	Lists are now always split at ';' characters instead of using the OS-specific path list separator char.
		This change should make things more consistent across OSes.
	rubble.ini now uses the same rules as the command line flag handler for parsing boolean values.
	Added an "installer" mode, it simply loads files from a single zip and then runs any ".inst.rex" scripts,
		use to install non-raw mods and addons automatically.
	Created a new GUI with support for prepping or regenerating a region (still windows only).
	The GUI now launches Rubble in installer mode when it is started with a command line argument.
		(this makes it support drag and drop installing)
	The GUI now supports a "minimal=true" option in it's INI that makes it not create the "Prep" and "Regen" tabs.
	Made all addons deterministic, this should make region regeneration possible.
		(in this case deterministic means that generated raw objects will always be in the same order for a given input)
		Changed addons:
			"Libs/Castes"
			"Libs/Castes/DFHack/Transform"
			"Libs/Crates"
			"Libs/DFHack/Command"
	Added two new templates: SHARED_OBJECT_KILL_TAG and SHARED_OBJECT_REPLACE_TAG, modify shared objects with minimum fuss.
	Rewrote "Fix/Undead Melt" to use SHARED_OBJECT_REPLACE_TAG, it is now much less brittle.
	All file access is now negotiated through AXIS VFS, this makes Rubble's directory structure MUCH more flexible.
		It should no longer be possible to write to arbitrary locations on the file system, so security should be much improved.
	The "file" and "fileio" script modules are no longer loaded, use the commands in the "axis" module instead.
	The various script directory variables have been removed as they are not needed with AXIS VFS.
	Added new base template: @IF_SKIP, conditionally skip a file with minimal fuss.
	Added addon "Tileset/Vanilla/Graphics": mostly just a demo of how to make creature graphic addons.
	Added four new tileset templates to "Base/Templates", these templates are for finer grain control of font settings.
	Added new addons, "Libs/Macro" and "Libs/Macro/Example": Generate macros from scripts.
	Added native script command rubble:activate_addon, force an addon active at any point.
	Renamed "Base/Templates" to "Libs/Base".
	"Libs/Base" is now forced active by init script during normal generation cycles.
	Removed "Base/Clear", replaced with an init script.
	Replaced the "Libs/Base" DFHack support with a much more flexible and less error prone system, no more extra install steps!
	Updated "Libs/DFHack/Add Reaction" to use the new DFHack support.
		There is no longer a need to prep between regions when using this addon.
	Moved "Base/Files" to "Base"
	Updated "Libs/Caste/DFHack/Transform" to use the newest DFHack stuff.
	Updated a LOT of documentation, and still more needs to be written...
