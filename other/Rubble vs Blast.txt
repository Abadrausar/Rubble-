Early versions of Rubble were heavily based on a similar utility, Blast, but recent versions resemble that utility only in the basic syntax.

Compared to Blast:
Pros:
	Comes with an extensive collection of "library addons" to help make modding easy
	Extensive support for DFHack
	No need for an external runtime, Rubble is a native application
	Addons may override each other's files (without a fragile diff system)
	Full parser/lexer, not just a bunch of regular expressions
	It's really easy to mix script code and raw text in a template, use whichever one is easier
	Variable expansion, no more GET_VAR, works in any parse stage
	Many templates for registering objects and the like are replacements for vanilla raw tags allowing better formatting
	Some files may be parsed but not included in the generated raws
	Support for easily and quickly installing tilesets from addons
	Allows you to run "tweak scripts" before or after generation for fine-tuning the results
	Support for external launchers via the command line
	Easy to use GUI to enable and disable addons (it's windows only, sorry)
	Addons can be grouped into directories to make relations clear (and to make addon packs easy to distribute)
	Support for loading addons (and groups of addons) directly from zip files
	Has an extra template prefix for greater flexibility
	Faster (not that it really matters)

Cons:
	No support for handling file name collisions in any way other than as an override
	No support for Blast namespaces (eg. @, @@, and @@@)
	Variables are simple key:value pairs instead of Blast's more powerful system
	No built-in pretty printer (unless, like me, you think of this as a pro :p)
	The scripting language isn't exactly mainstream


Why Another Raw Generator?

Blast is too... narrow. It allows you to do all kinds of stuff but is too hard (for me) to extend. Basically I just wanted something that allowed me to do most of the things I could do with Blast, but with less fuss and more power (well that and Blast generated really ugly output, if you need a pretty printer to make your generated output look good you are doing something wrong).

Of course if you know Perl and don't want to learn Rex (Rubble's scripting language) you will be in the same situation I was in with Blast, just in reverse ;)

I have put a huge amount of effort into making Rubble as flexible and powerful as possible, so newer features like tweak scripts and the addon loader make Blast look like a toy.
A cool, powerful toy, but a toy nonetheless.

Blast is still a good utility, but if you don't mind learning a new scripting language (and even if you do) Rubble is far more powerful.
