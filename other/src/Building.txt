Building Rubble from Source:
==============================================

To build Rubble you need to have Go (golang.org) installed.

One you have Go installed add <rubbledir>/other to your GOPATH or copy the contents of the src directory to a location on your GOPATH.

Now all you need to do is fire up a command prompt and run:
	go build rubble

When learning Rex it is very helpful to have the interactive shell available, to build the Rex shell:
	go build dctech/rex/rexsh

To build the GUI you need AutoIt v3 (www.autoitscript.com).
After installing AutoIt right click on the script and choose "Compile with Options", then click OK in the resulting dialog.
