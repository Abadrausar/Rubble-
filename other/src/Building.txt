Building Rubble:
==============================================

To build Rubble you need to have Go (golang.org) installed.

One you have Go installed add <rubbledir>/other to your GOPATH

Now all you need to do is fire up a command prompt and run:
go build rubble

If you plan on doing any modding with Rubble you may as well run:
go build dctech/raptor/raptor
This will compile the Raptor shell, which is a great learning tool.

All of the other packages that are included are dependencies of either Raptor or Rubble.
