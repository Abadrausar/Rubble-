    NCA v6 Shell Command.

FUNCTIONS

func CommandNCASH(state *nca6.State, params []*nca6.Value)
    Break into the NCA SHell. VERY useful for debuging! This command will
    provide an interactive shell until eof is reached, on windows this may
    be simulated by pressing CTRL+Z followed by <ENTER>.

	ncash

    Returns the return value of the last command to be run.

func Setup(state *nca6.State)
    Adds the ncash command to the state. The ncash command gives access to a
    shell much like NCASH6 that may be broken into at any time.
