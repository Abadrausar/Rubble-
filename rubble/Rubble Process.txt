
The Rubble Processing Pipeline

==============================================
Detailed Order of Execution
==============================================

	Commandline options are processed
	NCA4 is initalized
	Builtin templates are loaded
	All the files in the Base dir are loaded
	Any files in Addon dirs are loaded
		If -lextest=true the lexer test happens and Rubble exits
	All files are preparsed
	All files are parsed
	All files are postparsed
	All files have any variables outside of templates expanded
	All files are prepended with file ids and written to disk

==============================================
Anatomy of a Template Call
==============================================

	All leading and trailing whitespace is striped from the params
		If a param is of the form $<NAME> or ${<NAME>} then it is treated like a variable name and replaced with it's value
	If the template is a native template then it's handler is called and the template manager returns
	The templates body is loaded and these transforms are run on it:
		Text of the forms $<NAME> or ${<NAME>} that is not in a child template is replaced with the value of the variable <NAME>
		Text of the forms %<NAME> or %{<NAME>} is replaced with the value of the param named <NAME> or the default value specifyed for that param
		Text of the forms %N or %{N} (where N is an integer) is replaced with the value of the Nth param or the default value specifyed for that position if there is no Nth param
	The template body is passed to the parser for that stage
