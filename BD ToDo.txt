
Better Dorfs todo list
The following is a unsorted list of things I (may) want to add to better dorfs at some point

More invaders
	Add some togglable invader races for those who need more ‼fun‼
	Orcs, and maybe some sort of powerful late game monster, the kind that will give even the best defences problems

Dwarf castes
	Add a few castes to the dwarves, not too many

Training system
	Not sure if I want something as complicated as the masterwork library system

Combat arena
	A place to spawn creatures to fight. Basicly turn some kind of pet into a monster. Maybe allow the creation of necromancers for use in fancy traps, training systems, bone generators and more.

Look into providing support for installing bd onto a generic materials base
	This would need a generic materials Blast base

Maybe make elves and saurians mortal enemys?
	Not sure how (or if) this can be done without making elves hate dwarves as well
